    description: |
      Rewrote valet api, removing "applications" and "resources" in favor of just workflows and steps.

      Docs can now include templated valet references, to include contents of a workflow step in the rendered docs.

      Emphasis was added during the rewrite on go usability. `tests/e2e` has a fully-working example of the Gloo
      petclinic demo workflow to show how a demo workflow can be written as a concise, idiomatic golang test;
      as a yaml workflow that can be easily distributed and run with the command line tool; and as document that
      was rendered from a template, that references the same underlying valet workflow.
